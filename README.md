# Overview

Ever wanted to make your own tennis scoreboard? Never thought of it before but now you are? Let us show you how! It's a super fun project that take a little bit of coding (we'll provide the code to you), some fabrication (we'll tell you exactly what to do), and patience (can't help you there).

## Where we're headed

We're making this scoreboard. It's a fun way to keep score while you're playing a match or to just have around the house.

How much does it cost to make this thing? --> ???

## How it works - high level

Here are the core components:

- An LED panel driven by a little super simple computer called a "microcontroller".
- Code that we save on that little computer that can take your button presses and turn them into numbers that show up on the LED panel.
- A frame that you can 3D print.
- A power supply to keep the whole thing running.


## What you'll need

You need a few different things here:

- Some electronics you can purchase from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/).
- A power supply (either a power bank or a simple DC adapter if you have access to an outlet).
- Access to a 3D printer.
- Some basic tools (screwdriver, basic power drill).
- Paint.
